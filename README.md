# Learning Zig with Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2024, which I'm using as a way to learn the Zig programming language. Advent of Code is an annual series of programming puzzles that are released daily during December, making it a perfect opportunity to practice and improve my Zig skills.

## Goals

- Learn and understand Zig's syntax and features
- Practice problem-solving using Zig
- Explore Zig's standard library
- Improve my understanding of memory management and low-level programming concepts

## Structure

Each day's solution will be organized in its own directory, making it easy to track progress and review solutions.
